# 🌱 Sprout

Sprout is a lightweight, opinionated **CLI tool** designed to scaffold **Spring Boot layers** (Repositories, Services, DTOs) directly from your **JPA entities**.

By parsing your source code **AST**, Sprout automates the repetitive boilerplate required by a classic layered architecture — without relying on compiled classes or reflection.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AST Analysis**
    
    Uses **JavaParser** to analyze Java source code directly. No compilation step required.
    
- **Entity Metadata Extraction**
    
    Automatically detects `@Id` fields and infers identifier types for generated layers.
    
- **Mustache Templating**
    
    Clean separation between generation logic and code structure through Mustache templates.
    
- **Extensible Architecture**
    
    Built around pluggable `SproutGenerator`s, making it easy to add new layers (Services, Controllers, etc.).

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **JDK**: 1.8 or higher (Preferably JDK 17+)
- **Build Tool**: Maven 3.6.3+

### Building the Executable

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmineSidki/Sprout.git
cd Sprout

```

1. **Build the shaded JAR**

```bash
mvn clean package

```

The standalone executable will be generated at:

```
target/Sprout-1.0.jar

```

---

## 💻 Usage

Sprout operates **relative to a project root**.

- Use the `d` flag to point to your Spring Boot project directory.

```bash
java -jar Sprout-1.0.jar -d "/path/to/my-spring-project"

```

## ⚙️ CLI Options

| Flag | Long Form | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `-d` | `--dir` | Base directory containing the entity package |
| `-v` | `--version` | Print version information |
| `-h` | `--help` | Display usage guide |

---

## 💡 Pro Tips (Read This Before Running)

Sprout is designed for **speed and convention-over-configuration**. Following these rules avoids crash-first scenarios.

### 1 - Package Naming Convention

Sprout assumes your entities are located in a package ending with **`.entity`**.

It will automatically strip this suffix and replace it with the target layer name.

**Example**:

```
Input : com.example.project.entity
Output: com.example.project.repository

```

---

### 2 - Mandatory `@Id` Annotation

Sprout scans for the `@Id` annotation to determine the generic type of `JpaRepository`.

-  If an entity **does not** declare an `@Id`, it will be **skipped**.
-  A clear, descriptive error message will be displayed.

---

### 3 - Directory Mapping Assumptions

Currently, Sprout expects a **flat directory structure** during generation.

Example:

```
my-project/
├── entity/          <-- Source
└── repository/      <-- Destination (auto-created)

```

Make sure the destination directory is writable.

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [x] Base engine building

    - [x]  Repository Layer — Full JPA interface generation
    - [x]  Service Layer — CRUD business logic scaffolding
    - [x]  DTO Generation — Request / Response object mapping
    - [x]  Mappers Generation — DTO <--> Entity 
    - [x]  Multiplicity Support — `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne` handling


- [ ] Additionnal logic layers

    - [ ] Improve context awareness — Dynamic dependency manipulation depending on data
